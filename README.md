[This is my annotated notes based on Rust's excellent documentation.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

Please note the Projects section as these use many of the features that we spent learning on. I kept them in a separate folder for ease of personal use. Also, my chapters and the documentation's chapters are numbered differently, again since this is better for me. Finally, in the beginning, there may be some missing chapters since there were some concepts that I figured didn't need to be noted down due to their general ideas
